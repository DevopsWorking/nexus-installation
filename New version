To install Nexus Repository on a Unix server, you can follow these steps:

1. Install java on the system

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel

2. Download the Unix archive for the latest version of Nexus Repository. As of the latest information provided, you can download version 3.74.0 from Nexus Repository Download Page.

wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.74.0-05-unix.tar.gz

3. Extract the downloaded archive using the following command:

tar xvzf nexus-3.74.0-05-unix.tar.gz

4. For a production installation, it's recommended to install Nexus in a directory like /usr/local. You can use these commands:

sudo cp nexus-3.74.0-05-unix.tar.gz /usr/local
cd /usr/local
sudo tar xvzf nexus-3.74.0-05-unix.tar.gz
ln -s nexus-3.74.0-05 nexus


5. Create a dedicated user to run Nexus:

sudo useradd nexus

6. Configure Nexus to run as this user by editing the bin/nexus.rc file:

run_as_user="nexus"

7. To run Nexus as a service, you can use either init.d or systemd. For systemd, create a file called nexus.service in /etc/systemd/system/ with the following content:

[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/etc/init.d/nexus start
ExecStop=/etc/init.d/nexus stop 
User=nexus
Restart=on-abort
TimeoutSec=600

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

8. Activate the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable nexus.service
sudo systemctl start nexus.service

9. Verify that the service started successfully:

tail -f /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/log/nexus.log

These steps are based on the information from Run as a Service and Installation Methods.
Remember to ensure that you have a suitable Java runtime environment installed before starting the installation process.
